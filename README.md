## Diploma thesis

Collection of prototype scripts and notebooks oriented on simulated diffraction of light on blazed grating and measurement time estimation
Finalization expected in April

agilent_simulation.ipynb - code to  test which wavelengths and angles are to be scanned depending on the parameters, serving as a check for the measuring software in sax basic

difraction.ipynb - playing around with diffraction

diffraction_data_processing_and_simulation.ipynb - combination of loading data with diffraction simulation following OOP practices. At the end it should be able to load the scanned peaks, extrapolate envelope curve and fit the parmmeters, 
such as the period and height of the blaze grating
